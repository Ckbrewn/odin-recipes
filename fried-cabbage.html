      <h4>Steps:</h4>
          <ol>

            <li>Cook bacon pieces until extra crispy and remove from pan with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Leave about a tablespoon of bacon grease in the pan along with any burnt pieces stuck to the bottom of the pan (this has lots of flavor)</li>
            <li>Add onions to pan and toss onions with sugar.</li>
            <li>Cook until onions are tender and caramelized.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook until garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add butter and stir until butter is melted.</li>
            <li>Stir in red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Add cabbage to pot and toss so that cabbage is coated in the butter mixture.</li>
            <li>Let cabbage fry until tender, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Season cabbage generously with sea salt/seasoning salt, cracked black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve stir in bacon (or add it to individual bowls if you want it to remain extra crispy)</li>
